		  	<h1>H3H3</h1>
		  	<p> h3h3Productions (often shortened to h3h3 or simply h3) is an Israeli-American comedy YouTube channel produced by husband and wife team Ethan and Hila Klein,[1] formerly accompanied by longtime friend Sean Balogh. Their content mostly consists of reaction videos and sketch comedy where they satirize internet culture. In addition to their main channel they run a secondary vlog channel by the name of Ethan and Hila, and a third channel called H3 Podcast. The H3 Podcast channel features live-streams that were originally live on their Twitch.tv channel. The podcast covers a variety of topics, some controversial. Primarily, however, Ethan interviews celebrities and YouTubers, and the podcast has a "top of the week" segment.</p>
